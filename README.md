# HTMLAssessment

## Overview
### This is a demonstration of my ability to build an HTML document skeleton. My task was to build a correctly structured document that resembled the finished product example from the assignment prompt.

## Technologies Used
### I used the Atom text editor to build my HTML document, Google Chrome to preview my finished product, and Github to upload my assignment to the internet for evaluation by my instructors.

## Lessons Learned
### This was my first time ever messing with HTML. I somehow missed the trend in high school when many students were utilizing HTML on their MySpace accounts. I feel like HTML is truly as easy as I hear, and I look forward to seeing what I can do with CSS to spruce things up in future projects.
